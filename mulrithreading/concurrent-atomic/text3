OTHER RULES CONCERNING NUMBERS
Here are a few more rules concerning numbers to adhere to as you follow APA style:
If you are using two modifiers against a noun, use a combination of both numerals and words
Three 5-point scales
If you’re unsure which modifier to write and which to express numerically, try it both ways. Be sure the way you express the numbers is in the clearest way possible.
Place a zero before a decimal fraction less than 1 if the statistic can exceed 1.
0.54 in
If the statistic cannot exceed 1, you do not need a zero.
p = .85
